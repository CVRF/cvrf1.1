# cvrf
The ICASI Common Vulnerability Reporting Framework (CVRF) is an XML-based language that enables different stakeholders across different organizations to share critical security-related information in a single format, speeding up information exchange and digestion. CVRF is a common and consistent framework for exchanging not just vulnerability information, but any security-related documentation.
